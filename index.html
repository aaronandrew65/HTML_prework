                <h1>Why programming?</h1>
                <p>My wife introduced me into coding when she started her PhD and I have been interested ever since. I like the idea of problem solving and taking my ideas and bringing them to life.
                I have also always wanted to work with computers but have been too afriad to make that jump.</p>
